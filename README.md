## How It Works

### Currency System

- **Emeralds**: Currency earned from correct answers (1-3 per problem)
  - First attempt: 2-3 emeralds
  - Later attempts: 1 emerald
  - Can be spent in the shop on:
    - Power-ups (Double XP potions)
    - Themes (Dark mode, End theme)
    - Hint packs

### Progressive Unlocking
Topics unlock progressively as students complete problems:
- Complete 5 problems in any topic to unlock the next topic
- This ensures students master fundamentals before advancing
- All topics can eventually be unlocked through consistent practice

### Work Saving

- Teachers can review complete work history
- Export options for assessment and record-keeping

## Technologies
